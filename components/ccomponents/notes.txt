how to create component??
 this is the function that we can call inside vue it will take 2 parameter the 1st one is the name of the component the 2nd is going to be simply an object which is very similar to the object below
             var app = new Vue({
                el: '#app',
                data: {
                    
                }
            });
            
            the only slight difference is we don't have here root which is el: vue only have one single root elememt

 2.what is template key inside component?
 
  // template is the simply way we define the html or markup that is going to be outputed 
  -------------------------------
  
  3.what is the difference between the data prop inside component and inside vue object?
   // let's try to add data inside component... there is a caviet in the object down we have data that is just an object but inside component we can't have such a data the reason for that is a component has to have its own data..to have its own data it's actually need to be a fuction
                //so this is going to be function that return an object that's the only difference between the data prop in component and in below new vue obj..so again it's a function that returns an object versus data key that has an object already

e.g
<html>
    <head>
        <link href="https://unpkg.com/tailwindcss@^1.0/dist/tailwind.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
        <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="app">
             // just like custom html tag we can we can just open and close the component like this
            <first-component></first-component>
        </div>
        
        <script>
            Vue.component('first-component', {
                // template is the simply way we define the html or markup that is going to be outputed
                template: '<div>Hello from Component {{ message }}</div>',
                 // let's try to add data inside component... there is a caviet in the object down we have data that is just an object but inside component we can't have such a data the reason for that is a component has to have its own data..to have its own data it's actually need to be a fuction
                //so this is going to be function that return an object that's the only difference between the data prop in component and in below new vue obj..so again it's a function that returns an object versus data key that has an object already
                
                data: function () {
                    return {
                        message: 'Hello from Data'
                    }
                }
            });
            
            var app = new Vue({
                el: '#app',
                data: {
                    
                }
            });
